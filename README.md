# To-Do-List
A simple yet powerful web-based Task Management application that helps users organize their daily activities. This project focuses on DOM manipulation and data persistence using local storage. 
I'd like to say that this project wasn't heavily focused on HTML and CSS.
and this is my first project in js .
